      <div class="col-md-5">
        <p>For the past few decades, the United States as a whole has seen crime and arrests rates to be at a steady rate, to a slight decrease. However, in 2020 at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the crime and arrest rates had a dramatic drop due to quarantine and lockdowns throughout the country. 
        </p>

        <p>The graphic to the left specifically shows these trends within Erie County in New York State. It is shown from the years 2015-2019, arrests rates for misdemeanor and felony arrests were at a constant of around 15,000 misdemeanors, and around 5,000 felonies per year. However, this had a sudden drop off, making misdemeanor arrests hover around 6,000, and felonies a little over 4,000 in that year.
        </p> 

        <p>Misdemeanor arrests are generally at a higher rate because they are “generally punishable by a fine and incarceration in a local county jail,” according to <a href= "https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-law-basics/misdemeanors.html#:~:text=A%20misdemeanor%20is%20a%20criminal,which%20impose%20no%20jail%20time.">Findlaw.com</a>. Felony arrests, though not uncommon, do not occur as frequently as misdemeanors as it takes a much greater scale crime such as murder, burglaries, kidnapping, or arson to be considered a felony. These crimes typically result in punishments of greater prison sentences and fines. 
        </p>  

        <p>Therefore, the arrest rates dropped so dramatically due to the start of the pandemic that the total misdemeanor arrests dropped below the average total of felony arrests in Erie County for the previous 4 years.

      <h2>An interview with Officer Craig Johnson from the Amherst Police Department</h2>
      <p>Craig Johnson, Field Intelligence Officer of the <a href= "https://www.amherst.ny.us/content/departments.php?dept_id=dept_16">Amherst Police Department</a> in Erie County touches on why these trends of arrest rates and arrest type had such a sudden change at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. 
      </p>

      <p>“In the second half of the year, starting in the summer of 2020 we noticed property crimes increased a lot. Specifically stolen cars and stolen property from vehicles. Those were probably the two things we saw the largest spike in,” said Officer Johnson. 
      </p>

      <p>Though there was not one specific reason as to why property misdemeanor arrests took the place of the highest total among all arrest types in 2020, Officer Johnson shares his first hand knowledge as to what he feels was the most common reason.
      </p>

      <p>“As 2020 was the first summer of Covid, by May and June we started to see these crimes had a huge  spike. We had a lot of teenage crime, a lot of kids going through cars, because they thought there was nothing else to do,” said Officer Johnson. “Everything was shut down and there was nowhere to go, nothing else to do. They all started to hang outside as the weather got warmer and thought they could get away with these small property crimes.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only did small misdemeanor property crimes spike during the pandemic, but Officer Johnson also noted that the Amherst Police Department noticed a rise in cars being stolen. These crimes were typically done by “young gang members that came from the two bordering cities.” 
      </p>

      <p>Being employed at the Amherst Police Department for 25 years, Officer Johnson mentioned that over his time working, he never noticed such a large number of property crimes in such a short period of time. Therefore, even though the pandemic caused the overall total number of crimes and arrests to have a sudden drop, lockdowns only caused certain types of crimes to increase. 
      </p>

        <p>With the sudden drop in crime and arrest rates in 2020, the breakdown of the total number of each type of arrest shows that misdemeanors and felonies categorized as “other” made up the majority of arrests. Within “other,” however, it is broken down into crimes that would not make up much of the total alone at all.  
        </p>

        <p>DWI felony arrests were at an all time low because of the limited number of people on the roads after drinking. Covid lockdowns caused many bars to be closed down for an extended period of time, decreasing the number of DWI charges, ranking it the lowest in total number of arrests by charge.
        </p>

        <p>According to NBC News, violent felonies in the entire country, including homicides had been at a steady increase for the previous few years, but rose greatly during the pandemic due to <a href= "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/overall-crime-decreased-2020-united-states-report-finds-n1278938">economic and emotional strain from Covid lockdowns</a>. This data is shown greatly on a smaller scale within Erie County.  
        </p>

        <p>Because it is much easier for a crime to be considered a misdemeanor, the total number of these types of arrests still remained at a higher total than felonies during the pandemic, regardless of how they are broken down in arrest type.
